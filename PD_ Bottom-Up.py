#1. The user is prompted to enter the length of the rod n.
#2. The user is then asked to enter the price for each length of rod.
#3. cut_rod is called and the lists r and s are returned.
#4. r[n] is the maximum revenue that we can earn from a rod of length n.
#5. The way to cut the rod is determined using s where s[i] tells you the length of the first piece to cut of from a rod of length i.
#6. So s[n] gives us the length of the first piece, s[n â€“ s[n]] gives us the length of the second piece and so on.
